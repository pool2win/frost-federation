== System Model

=== Network Connectivity

. A federation of nodes with point to point network connectivity.
. All point to point connections are authenticate and confidential
using Noise Protocol.
. All point to point connections are reliable with no ordering
guarantees.
. Echo-broadcast between all nodes to satisfy the FROST broadcast
channel requirements.
. Clocks synchronised using ntp to satisfy partial synchrony
requirements.

=== Round Time

. Round time of 5 seconds [TODO: Determine this if this is enough for
a network of size 100 nodes, and then adjust this as required]


== Federation Clients

. Clients connect to any node in the federation and send data and
commands to any node in the federation.
. The federation synchronises data and commands received from
clients.

== Threshold Signatures

. The federation runs preprocessing DKG rounds every fixed interval
. On client requests or on the need from within the federation, a
threshold signature is generated for the provided message.

=== Validate Before Signing

. The federation is provided a validation protocol it runs on the
synchronised data, before it generates a threshold signature.
. This allows clients to use the federation as a BFT validation and
signature generation service
